   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Happyesss/Fairlx.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

5. **Configure Appwrite**
   - Create an Appwrite project
   - Set up database and collections following [md/APPWRITE_SETUP.md](md/APPWRITE_SETUP.md)
   - Add collection IDs to `.env.local`

6. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash

## Development Workflow

### Staying Up to Date

Before starting work, ensure your fork is up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
# or
git checkout -b chore/task-description
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write code** following our [Code Style & Standards](#code-style--standards)
2. **Test your changes** locally
3. **Run linting**: `npm run lint`
4. **Run tests**: `npm run test`
5. **Commit your changes** following [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines)

### Pushing Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow:

### Branch Types

| Branch | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | `main` |
| `feature/*` | New features | `feature/workflow-ai` |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes | `fix/billing-calculation` |
| `chore/*` | Maintenance tasks | `chore/update-deps` |
| `docs/*` | Documentation only | `docs/api-reference` |
| `refactor/*` | Code refactoring | `refactor/project-structure` |

### Branch Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include issue number if applicable

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(workflows): add AI status suggestions` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(billing): correct usage calculation` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): update setup instructions` |
| `style` | Code style changes | `style(tasks): fix indentation` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | `refactor(auth): simplify session logic` |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | `perf(queries): add caching` |
| `test` | Adding tests | `test(projects): add creation tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |

## Code Style & Standards

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit types preferred
- No `any` - use specific types or `unknown`
- Type imports: `import type` for types

### React Components

- Server Components by default
- Client Components marked with `"use client"`
- PascalCase naming
- Props interface for every component

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS utilities
- Mobile-first responsive
- Support all themes (light, dark, pitch-dark)
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes

### API Routes

- Session middleware for protected routes
- Zod validation for inputs
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Type-safe with Hono

---

## Testing Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain or improve coverage

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npx playwright test
```

---

## Documentation

Update documentation when you:
- Add new features
- Change existing behavior
- Modify API endpoints
- Update database schema
- Change environment variables

---

## Security

**Do NOT report security vulnerabilities via public issues.**

To report a vulnerability:
1. Use GitHub's Security tab
2. Provide detailed information
3. We will respond within 48 hours

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets
- Validate all inputs server-side
- Sanitize user data
- Check permissions server-side
- Follow OWASP guidelines
