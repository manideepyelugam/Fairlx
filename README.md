All Hono API routes enforce permissions server-side:

```typescript
// Example from src/features/projects/server/route.ts
app.delete("/:projectId", sessionMiddleware, async (c) => {
  const user = c.get("user");
  const { projectId } = c.req.param();
  
  // Check project admin permission
  const hasPermission = await checkProjectPermission(
    user.$id,
    projectId,
    "DELETE_PROJECT"
  );
  
  if (!hasPermission) {
    return c.json({ error: "Forbidden" }, 403);
  }
  
  // Proceed with deletion
  // ...
});
```

```

### Usage Metering

Three types of usage are tracked:

| Type | Measurement | Rate (Default) |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Traffic** | Data transfer (GB) | ₹0.10 per GB |
| **Storage** | Storage used (GB/month) | ₹0.05 per GB/month |
| **Compute** | Compute units (API calls, operations) | ₹0.001 per unit |

### Billing Lifecycle

1. **Usage Tracking** (Continuous)
   - Every user action creates a usage event
   - Events stored in `usage_events` collection
   - Tracked: organizationId, type, amount, timestamp

2. **Daily Aggregation** (Cron - 1 AM UTC)
   - Rollup events into daily totals
   - Store in `usage_aggregations` collection
   - Cleanup old events (retention policy)

3. **Monthly Billing Cycle** (Cron - 1st of month)
   - Calculate total usage from aggregations
   - Generate invoice with breakdown
   - Attempt Razorpay payment (e-mandate)
   - Update account status

4. **Grace Period** (14 days default)
   - Day 1: Payment failed, status → DUE
   - Day 1: Send email notification
   - Day 7: Send reminder email
   - Day 13: Send final warning
   - Day 14: Account suspended

5. **Account Suspension**
   - Status → SUSPENDED
   - Writes blocked (middleware enforcement)
   - Reads allowed
   - Billing page accessible for payment

6. **Recovery**
   - User completes payment
   - Status → ACTIVE
   - Access restored immediately

### Billing Enforcement

Middleware prevents mutations for suspended accounts:

```typescript
// src/lib/billing-enforcement.ts
export const mutationGuard = async (c: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) => {
  const user = c.get("user");
  
  // Check if organization account
  if (user.prefs.accountType === "ORG") {
    const billingAccount = await getBillingAccount(
      user.prefs.primaryOrganizationId
    );
    
    if (billingAccount.status === "SUSPENDED") {
      return c.json({ error: "Account suspended. Please update billing." }, 402);
    }
  }
  
  await next();
};
```

### Razorpay Integration

- **E-Mandate**: Automated monthly debit from customer's account
- **Webhooks**: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`, `refund.processed`
- **Signature Verification**: All webhooks validated before processing
- **Idempotency**: Processed events registry prevents duplicate operations

### Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `BILLING_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` | Days before suspension | 14 |
| `BILLING_CURRENCY` | Invoice currency | INR |
| `USAGE_RATE_TRAFFIC_GB` | Cost per GB traffic (cents) | 0.10 |
| `USAGE_RATE_STORAGE_GB_MONTH` | Cost per GB/month storage (cents) | 0.05 |
| `USAGE_RATE_COMPUTE_UNIT` | Cost per compute unit (cents) | 0.001 |
| `ENABLE_EMANDATE` | Enable e-mandate | false |

### Billing Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `billing_accounts` | Organization billing accounts |
| `invoices` | Generated invoices with usage breakdown |
| `usage_events` | Raw usage events |
| `usage_aggregations` | Daily usage rollups |
| `storage_snapshots` | Storage usage snapshots |
| `billing_audit_logs` | Billing activity audit trail |
| `processed_events` | Idempotency registry |
| `usage_alerts` | Usage threshold alerts |

### Development Guidelines

#### TypeScript

- **Strict mode enabled**: All code must satisfy TypeScript strict checks
- **Explicit types**: Prefer explicit type annotations over inference
- **No `any`**: Use specific types or `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- **Type imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports

```typescript
// Good
import type { User } from "@/types";
const user: User = await getUser(id);

// Bad
import { User } from "@/types";
const user = await getUser(id);  // Relies on inference
```

#### Server Components vs Client Components

- **Default to Server Components**: Use unless client interactivity required
- **Client Components**: Only for interactivity, browser APIs, React hooks
- **Mark with `"use client"`**: At the top of client component files

```typescript
// Client component (interactive)
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}

// Server component (default)
export async function UserList() {
  const users = await getUsers();  // Server-side data fetch
  return <div>{users.map(u => <UserCard key={u.id} user={u} />)}</div>;
}
```

#### Tailwind CSS

- **Utility-first**: Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Dark mode**: Support light, dark, and pitch-dark themes
- **Component composition**: Compose utilities with `cn()` helper

```typescript
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

<div className={cn(
  "px-4 py-2 rounded-lg",
  "bg-white dark:bg-slate-800",
  isActive && "border-2 border-blue-500"
)} />
```

#### shadcn/ui Components

- **Use existing components**: Don't recreate primitives
- **Extend with variants**: Use `class-variance-authority` for variations
- **Composition over props**: Compose primitives instead of complex props

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// Good - composition
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">Click</Button>

// Bad - custom styling
<button className="...custom classes...">Click</button>
```

#### API Routes (Hono)

- **Session middleware**: Always use for protected routes
- **Zod validation**: Validate all inputs
- **Error handling**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Type safety**: Use Hono's type inference

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { zValidator } from "@hono/zod-validator";
import { sessionMiddleware } from "@/lib/session-middleware";
import { createFeatureSchema } from "./schemas";

const app = new Hono()
  .post(
    "/",
    sessionMiddleware,
    zValidator("json", createFeatureSchema),
    async (c) => {
      const user = c.get("user");
      const data = c.req.valid("json");
      
      // Implementation
      return c.json({ data: result });
    }
  );
```

#### TanStack Query

- **Query hooks**: For data fetching (GET operations)
- **Mutation hooks**: For data modification (POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- **Query keys**: Use consistent key structure
- **Cache invalidation**: Invalidate related queries after mutations

```typescript
// Query hook
export const useGetFeatures = (workspaceId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["features", workspaceId],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await client.api.features.$get({
        query: { workspaceId }
      });
      return await response.json();
    },
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,  // 5 minutes
  });
};

// Mutation hook
export const useCreateFeature = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: CreateFeatureData) => {
      const response = await client.api.features.$post({ json: data });
      return await response.json();
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["features"] });
    },
  });
};
```

#### Route Utilities

- **Safe navigation**: Always use route utilities for navigation
- **Validate IDs**: Never navigate with undefined/invalid IDs
- **Type safety**: Route utilities provide compile-time type checking

```typescript
import { buildWorkspaceRoute } from "@/lib/route-utils";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

const router = useRouter();

// Good
const route = buildWorkspaceRoute(workspaceId, "/settings");
router.push(route);

// Bad
router.push(`/workspaces/${workspaceId}/settings`);  // No validation
```

#### File Uploads

- **Validate size**: Check file size before upload
- **Validate type**: Check MIME type
- **Use buckets**: Upload to appropriate Appwrite bucket
- **Show progress**: Display upload progress to user

```typescript
const file = event.target.files[0];

// Validate
if (file.size > 50 * 1024 * 1024) {
  toast.error("File too large (max 50MB)");
  return;
}

// Upload
const result = await storage.createFile(
  ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET_ID,
  ID.unique(),
  file
);
```

### Code Style

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier defaults (enforced by ESLint)
- **Naming**:
  - Components: PascalCase (`UserCard.tsx`)
  - Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`usePermission.ts`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Imports**: Order by external → internal → relative
- **Comments**: Explain "why", not "what"
