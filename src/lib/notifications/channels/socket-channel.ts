/**
 * Socket Channel Handler
 * 
 * Handles real-time push notifications via HTTP bridge to the custom server.
 * 
 * Implementation:
 * - Makes HTTP POST to /internal/socket-push endpoint on the main server
 * - The main server then emits via Socket.IO
 * - Fire-and-forget semantics (non-blocking)
 * - Fails silently with logging
 * 
 * The dispatcher calls this AFTER storing the notification in the database,
 * so users always have a fallback to see missed notifications.
