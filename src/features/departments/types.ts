/**
 * Department - Organizational permission unit
 * 
 * RULES:
 * - Departments belong to an organization (org-level)
 * - Users can belong to multiple departments
 * - Departments OWN org-level permissions
 * - Members gain org access ONLY via department membership
 * - Permissions are UNIONED across all departments a member belongs to
 * 
 * INVARIANTS:
 * - Member without departments has ZERO org permissions
 * - OWNER role bypasses department check (super-role exception)
 * - Permissions never float outside a department
 * 
 * USE CASES:
 * - Engineering dept with WORKSPACE_CREATE permission
 * - Finance dept with BILLING_VIEW, BILLING_MANAGE permissions
 * - HR dept with MEMBERS_VIEW, MEMBERS_MANAGE permissions
